* Chapter 2: Types, Operaters and Expressions
** Type
1. short and int are at least 16-bit long. longs are at least 32-bit
      long. short must not longer than int, which must not longer than long.
      Normally, short is 16-bit long while int and long are 32-bit long.

2. Constant expressions are expressions that only involves constants. The
      exact value of such expression is known at compile time rather than
      run-time. Constant expression is different from "constant".

3. Non-automatic variable can only be initialize once. Extern and static
   variable is initialize to zero by default.

4. Direction of truncation for / and the sign of the result for % is machine
   dependent, as is the action taken on overflow or underflow.

5. #include <stdbool.h>

** Operaters
1. Precedence

** Type conversion
1. If an expression only involves int type, int operations are performed. If
   there is one float type, floating point operations are performed.
